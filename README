# Bird Species Classification using Neural Networks

This project focuses on accurately classifying bird species by integrating both **image** and **textual** data using Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and traditional Machine Learning techniques.

It was developed as part of a team submission for the **AI/ML General Championship at IIT Bombay**.

## Project Overview

We developed a **multi-modal classification system** combining:
- **Image-based features** extracted through convolutional models
- **Text-based features** using NLP on bird species descriptions
- A **hybrid neural network** trained on the fused data from both sources

The model predicts the correct **bird species (1 out of 200)** by leveraging visual cues and descriptive text.

## Dataset

We used the **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200)** dataset:
- 11,788 high-quality bird images
- 200 distinct bird species
- Textual descriptions for each class

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data processing and overall pipeline
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow** – Neural network modeling
- **OpenCV & PIL** – Image preprocessing and augmentation
- **Scikit-learn** – Evaluation metrics and ML utilities
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** – Data handling and visualization
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash

   cd bird-species-classification
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
   - Download the CUB-200-2011 dataset from the [official source](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html)
   - Extract the dataset to the `data/` directory

### Running the Project

## Model Architecture

Our multi-modal approach consists of:

1. **Image Processing Pipeline:**
   - Convolutional Neural Network for feature extraction
   - Data augmentation and preprocessing

2. **Text Processing Pipeline:**
   - NLP preprocessing of species descriptions
   - Text vectorization and embedding

3. **Fusion Network:**
   - Combines image and text features
   - Final classification layer for 200 species
