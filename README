# Bird Species Classification using Neural Networks

This project focuses on accurately classifying bird species by integrating both **image** and **textual** data using Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and traditional Machine Learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of a team submission for the **AI/ML General Championship at IIT Bombay**.

## Project Overview

We developed a **multi-modal classification system** combining:
- **Image-based features** extracted through convolutional models
- **Text-based features** using NLP on bird species descriptions
- A **hybrid neural network** trained on the fused data from both sources

The model predicts the correct **bird species (1 out of 200)** by leveraging visual cues and descriptive text.

## Dataset

We used the **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200)** dataset:
- 11,788 high-quality bird images
- 200 distinct bird species
- Textual descriptions for each class
